# happy-kaktus

Scrap news about `mujkaktus.cz` *happy hours* and publish them on a Telegram channel

This script is periodically run by a GitHub action and whenever
there seems to be a new happy hours event happening, it sends a message
into a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/kvetinac).

In general, the happy hours occur twice per month, around 8th and 23th,
between 17 and 20 hours.
